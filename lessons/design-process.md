- Test / feedback loop

# Requirements

Deep understanding leads to good design.

- What is the problem?
- What is the solution?
- Challenge assumptions
- Approach from all angles
- What is the user's motivation?
- What is their context?
  - Where'd they come from?
  - What is their mental model like?

---

# Identify MVP

- Minimum Viable Product
- What's the least you can do to ship something useful?

---

# Work on copy

- Write text first
- Reduce it
- Reduce it again
- Maximize meaning to word ratio
- What does the user need to know here?
- What is their mental context?
- Personas
  - Who are they?
  - What else do they like?
  - How are those things marketed?
- What is the tone / personality of the site?

---

# Example

- Redesign the Iron Yard landing page
- What does it need to say?

---

# Wireframe

- Multiple options
- Low resolution / fat marker
- Content-driven
  - Content drives design
  - Design does not drive content
- Consider the following
  - Is there an expected pattern/approach to the problem?
  - Guide the user's eye
  - Easily scannable content
  - Consistent alignment
  - Consistent representation of related elements
  - Hierarchy of importance
    - What is the primary action here? It should be big and clear

---


# Example

- TIY landing page continued
- What layouts communicate our mission?

---

# Feedback loop

- Rapid iteration, fast feedback
- Hallway user testing
- Don't ask leading questions:
  - Bad: "What do you think happens when you click Submit?"
  - Good: "You accidentally added something to your cart and want to remove it. What do you do?"
- Bigger-budget stuff: eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, heat-maps, etc

---

# Build / prototype

- Prototypes
  - Supposed to be throwaway code
  - Never get thrown away
  - Turn into zombies

# Build / prototype (contd)

- Look at your wireframe
- Identify and name the components
  - Header
  - Main navigation
  - Profile summary
    - Photo
    - Name
    - Edit link
- Scaffold via HTML
  - Your names become CSS classes
- Style via CSS
  - Reset
  - Defaults
  - Structure / layout
  - Theme
    - Colors, backgrounds, fonts, etc

---

# Feedback loop

- Show your design when it's still slightly uncomfortable
- Get feedback often
- Ship often
- Measure all the things

---

# Example / exercise

Tasked with designing a shopping cart

- What is the user's context?
- What are their expectations?
  - Consistency same frame, colors, fonts, main-nav, etc
- What is their motivation?
  - Seeing their total?
  - Checking out?
  - Scanning the list to see if they missed anything or have too much of something?

## Books

[Don't Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416519930&sr=8-1&keywords=don%27t+make+me+think)
is a classic, must read for any front-end engineer or designer.

[The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416520014&sr=8-1&keywords=the+design+of+everyday+things)
is one of the best design books ever written. But it is more academic, and not
really focused on digital media at all.

[The Emyth](http://www.amazon.com/The-E-Myth-Revisited-Michael-Gerber-ebook/dp/B000RO9VJK)
is not a design book, but a systems/process book. If you want to build a
personal brand (or a business) this is the book for you.
