# What is Typography?

* One of the goals of good design is capturing the user's attention.

* Attention is the user's gift to you -- and it can be taken away.

* The content may be incredible, but if it's difficult to read, you lose the reader's attention.

* "The web is 95% typography." - Oliver Reichenstein.

# Web Fonts

* Only a handful of fonts look similar across all browsers and systems.
  * Web-safe fonts include:
      * Arial / Helvetica
      * Times New Roman / Times
      * Courier New / Courier

* Web fonts are downloaded by the user's browser and then applied to your text.
  * Expands your font arsenal but can slow the site's load time.

* How do you get it on your page?

* Use web fonts sparingly and with precision.
