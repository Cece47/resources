# Number guessing

## Description

Games are fun. And they are a really handy way to get used to combining logic
with UI manipulation. We'll be creating a number guessing game for tonight's
assignment.

## Objectives

- Get lots of reps in using the DOM
- Updating the UI from JavaScript
- Responding to events

## Details

### Normal Mode

- If you haven't already, finish the in-class exercise
  - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 10
  - The user enters a guess
  - The computer tells the user if the guess is too big, too small, or just right

- Flip the problem on its head
  - User thinks up a number between 1 and 10
  - Computer makes a random guess
  - User clicks a button to say: 'Too low', 'Too high', or 'You guessed it!'

- How could you ensure the computer always wins within 4 guesses?

## Hard Mode

- Show a visual indication (progress bar or "Guess 2 of 4") of how many turns are remaining

### Dropdown menu

- Create another page called `dropdown-demo.html`
- Implement this: https://dribbble.com/shots/1027783-Dropdown-Menu?list=searches&tag=dropdown_menu&offset=8
- When the user clicks the profile button, the menu should show
- When the user clicks anywhere in the document, the menu should hide

### Chat window

- Create another page called `chat-demo.html`
- It might look something like this:
- https://dribbble.com/shots/1818748-Appon-Chat-Widget?list=searches&tag=chat&offset=50
- When the user enters a message, take their message and display it along with
the time when the message was added
